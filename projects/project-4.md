summary: Creating a web application for UH Manoa musicians
---
## Objective

For our final project, we had to group up with three others to develop a website to help the community of UH Manoa. To create this website, we needed to incorporate all that we learned throughout the semester. The website my group developed is called Sessh, a website for the musicians of UH Manoa to find others with similar tastes so that they may coordinate with one another to meet up. For instance, they could set up a music session of some sort, hence the name sessh. Some of the things that we had to incorporate for this final project include following but are not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>Semantic UI React</li>
  <li>Meteor</li>
  <li>Functional Programming</li>
  <li>Design Patterns</li>
  <li>Deployment</li>
</ul>
