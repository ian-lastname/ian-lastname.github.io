For High School Psychology, I had a group project where we needed to make a museum exhibit for a part of the human body. My group got assigned the human brain, and so we had to make some sort of model of a brain to showcase to the class. We also had to do a presentation while showcasing it, though I might be misremembering things since that happened like two years ago. 

Essentially, we split up the work into different parts of the brain. My role was to create the cerebellum part of our exhibit. I did the research on the cerebellum, and I created a model of it using cardboard and newspaper. The cardboard was used to set up the structure of the model, and the newspaper was used to create the surface or the 'skin'. Then I painted it pink and honestly, it didn't turn out that bad. I mean, it could've been better, and there probably was a better way of doing it. But the important thing is that you could tell what it was just by looking at it.

The project taught me a lot about the importance of coordination and team work. Our group had pretty good coordination, and so we got the project done fairly quickly with a good grade. I suppose I also learned how to work as a team better.
