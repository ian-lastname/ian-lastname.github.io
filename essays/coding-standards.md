## What Do I Think of Coding Standards?

Ultimately, I think of coding standards as something that is both a blessing and a curse. For starters, it makes your code look very clean and readable, which is always a plus. Not
only that, but it also trains one on how to create good looking code, and just gives a general idea on what it should look like. However, it does get annoying when transitioning
from one coding standard to another. It's especially annoying when the new coding standard you're getting into is really similar to the one you're used to, with the exception
of really small things like indentation. It's all really trivial considering that since the only differences are tiny things like indentation, the code ultimately looks basically the
same regardless of the coding style. So overall, I think of it as a useful yet annoying idea.

## ESLint and my Thoughts

ESLint is actually quite useful and does its job well. I mean, it tells you what you did wrong and shows exactly where you did it wrong in. I've never really used a program like
ESLint in my previous classes since in those previous classes, having incorrect coding standards would only lose me minimum points. But, now that I'm using it, I now know the
value of using such a program. Oh and to note, getting that green arrow is quite possibly one of the most satisfying moments in my time programming in this class; but on the flip
side, getting anything else is migraine-inducing.

## The Legend of the Idiot Who Didn't Read the Directions

Now you're probably wondering, "what's with that part of the title?." Well, I got a potentially funny story for you. You see, the legend in question is actually me, and I didn't read
the directions for installing ESLint. Now, it wasn't so bad because I 'fixed' my improper installation of it on the 8th of February, so I was ready to take the actual WOD; or so 
I thought. On the day of the actual WOD, I got an error when trying to install ESLint onto my project; a mistake that costed me 2 minutes of my precious time for solving the WOD.

Now, I was extremely close to finishing it, but unfortunately I ran out of time. Maybe if I had the 2 minutes that got wasted, I could've figured out what I did wrong in time; and
it was an extremely simple fix too. So yeah, I'm pretty miffed about this whole ordeal.
