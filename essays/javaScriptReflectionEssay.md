Ah Java Script, I first heard about this language from a friend who's much more well versed in programming than I am. I don't really remember exactly what he said about it, but it pretty much boiled down to it being weird but nice to use when you get the hang of it. After having gone through that crash course of Java Script, I can't help but agree with his sentiments. I mean, personally from what I've seen so far, I'd probably choose C or C++ over Java Script, but my opinions might change the more I use it. That's not to say that I think it's a bad language, quite the opposite in fact.

Some things that I found particularily useful about Java Script is destructuring and the use of objects. In the case of objects, there were some applications of it that I wouldn't have ever thought of. For instance, in a coding excercise where I had to create a function that checked for duplicates in a string, I had never thought that I could "store" each character the string in an object. For destructuring, I like how it makes variable assignments from things like arrays a lot more simpler.

Also, I find the practice WODs to be extremely useful for my learning. You know what they say; practice makes perfect, and honestly, I wouldn't be getting any actual practice outside of these practice WODs. While it is helpful, it does add some pressure as I am doing it for the sake of passing the graded WODs. Regardless, I am thankful that I'm actually given some means of preparing myself for the graded WODs.
