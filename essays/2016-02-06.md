To be completely honest, I wasn't always too keen on programming. When I started to really think about what I wanted to do as a career, I had thought about making video games. I mean, it made sense considering that I enjoy playing them. However, at the time I felt that it would be too hard for me to ever get into programming. So instead, I latched onto the idea that I would become a lawyer when I grew up. Now that I think about it, I have no idea why I did that but I did. It wasn't until the summer before my senior year that I actually got a taste of what programming was, albiet it was an extremely tiny one. I actually found it pretty fun; or at least, much more fun than lawyer stuff.

So yeah, from that point on I got interested in becoming a programmer of some sort. Specifically, I'd like to do game development because that's the one thing I really wanted to do had I ever gotten into this field. My first step to do any work any kind of work like that was to, well, actually learn something about programming. I started with taking ICS 111 in my freshman year; which was a little over a year ago since the time I'm typing this out. I have to say, I've learned a lot up until now, but I guess I've really just begun.

For the future, I hope that I just get more general experience in programming. I mean, I'm definitely going to get experience down the line, I just hope that it sticks with me in the long run. I also really want to develop some skills in programming with graphics and such. I really want to make something that people would like in the future, like they would look at it and be like "huh, that's pretty neat."
