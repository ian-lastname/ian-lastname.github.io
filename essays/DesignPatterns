Often times, when I want to make something, I always want to make it the best way I can; atleast, to a degree. Though, figuring out how to do such a thing could take
a lot of time. On top of that, often times I find myself doing things one way, but then finding out that someone else did it in a much better way than myself.
So what do I do when I find myself in such a predicament? Well, I just follow what that other person did to get the best possible results, but I do it in a way
so that it applies to whatever I am trying to make.
